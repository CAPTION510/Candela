There are a few steps in order to use ssf_selected.
1) prepare INPUT, run D310, if you don't have the "SSF.input" file in the directory,
you get a file named SSF.input0.

2) Follow the printed instructions, sort the 4th column of SSF.input0 and put
the new results to SSF.input1.

3) select you wanted q in SSF.input1, and add the total
number of q in the first line of SSF.input1, run the code again and you will
get the final "SSF.input"

4) add the number of lines in the first line of SSF.input,
delete SSF.input0 and SSF.input1 and the code will read "SSF.input" to calcualte the selected
static structure factor
