This INPUT generate the distribution of MLWFs and dipole moements.

distribution_MLWF.dat: the distribution of MLWF.
distribution_dipole.dat: the distribution of dipole moements.

This calculation can also generate dipole moments along each
direction for each water molecule in order to compute the 
velocity of dipole mements.

The velocity of dipole moments can be used to calculate the
autocorrelation function and then the infrred spectra can be obtained.
