------------------------------------ EXPLAIN hbcase.dat FILE -----------------------------------------------
In the hbcase.dat file, each line represents the H-bond network information for 
a hydronium (H3O+) or hydroxide (OH-) ion. For example:

1    476555        40.3456   16  3  0    8   26   40    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0

Here 476555 is the snapshot index, 40.3456 is the time in ps.

The next '16' is the index of oxygen that belongs to the ion.

The next '3' is the number of accepted HB for the ion.

The next '0' is the number of donating HB for the ion.

The next 8 numbers are the index of oxygen atoms that donating H bonds to the ion.
These numbers start from 1 and 0 means no oxygen atoms. In other words, 
here 8, 26 and 40 indicate that the ion 
accepts H-bonds from water molecules with oxygen indexes being 5, 26, and 40. 

The next 4 numbers are the index of oxygen atoms that accept H bonds to the ion. 
These numbers start from 1 and 0 means no oxygen atoms. 

------------------------------------ EXPLAIN bond.dat FILE -------------------------------------------------
In the bond.dat file, the H-bond network information is printed 
out for each oxygen atom in a water molecule. For example:

476555 40.3456
 atom    1 A 2 D 2   57   63    0    0    0    0    0    0    8   64    0    0    476555   40.3456

Here 476555 is the snapshot index, 40.3456 is the time in ps.

The number after "atom" in the index for oxygen atoms starting from 1.

The number after "A" is the number of accepted H-bonds for this oxygen atom.

The number after "D" is the number of donating H-bonds for this oxygen atom.

The next 8 numbers are the index of oxygen atoms that donating H bonds to the 1st (the number after "atom") oxygen atom.
These numbers start from 1 and 0 means no oxygen atoms. In other words, 
here 57 and 63 indicate that the 1st oxygen atoms (number after "atom") 
accept H-bonds from water molecules with oxygen indexes being 57 and 63. 

The next 4 numbers are the index of oxygen atoms that accept H bonds to the 1st (the number after "atom") oxygen atom.
These numbers start from 1 and 0 means no oxygen atoms. In other words,
here 8 and 64 indicate that the 1st oxygen atoms (number after "atom")
donate H-bonds from water molecules with oxygen indexes being 8 and 64.

The last two numbers are again the snapshot index and the time.

------------------------------------ EXPLAIN trans.dat file -----------------------------------------------
This file records the PROTON TRANSFER information:

    328610        27.8219   25  0  3    328580        27.8193   39  1  3  103

Here at snapshot 328610, the water ion is located at oxygen 25 (starting from 1), 
which accepts 0 H-bonds but donates 3 H-bonds, this is the new snapshot recorded
after proton transfer from an oxygen to another oxygen finished. 
In fact, the proton transfer process occurs between since 328580 snapshot
At snapshot 328580, the proton starts to leave from oxygen with index 39 
and accepts 1 H-bond and donates 3 H-bonds. The index of proton (hydrogen) 
that involves in this process has an index of 103.

------------------------------------ EXPLAIN solvation_angle.dat file --------------------------------------
In the solvation_angle.dat file, we record the angles formed by H-O1-O2, where O1 is the oxygen that 
H belongs to. 

Degrees Ion Water
0 0.0139665 0.00410267

Here it means at angle 0 degree, the distribution for the H-bond angles around ion and water.

------------------------------------ EXPLAIN solvation_distance.dat file -----------------------------------
In the solvation_distance.dat file, we record the distance of solvation atoms for accepted and donating
HBs for ions.

index accept_dis donate_dis
2.39 0 1.58046

Here it means the distribution of solvation atoms (accepted O or donating O) at distance 2.39 Angstroms.

------------------------------------ EXPLAIN waterwire.dat file --------------------------------------------
In the waterwire.dat file, we report the waterwires formed around ions, so this file only prints out data
when system is "hydronium" or "hydroxide". 

328390 27.8032

O123 39 11 32 h12 75 96

O123 39 40 23 h12 39 104
O123 39 40 52 h12 39 40

here 328390 is the snapshot index, 27.8032 is the trajectory time in ps
6 means 6 waterwires found.

O123 means 39, 11, and 32 are the indexes of three oxygen atoms (starting from 1) that form
a water wire. The first index 39 is the index for ion.
In hydronium system, 39 donates a HB to 11, and 11 donates a HB to 32.
However, in hydroxide system, 30 accepts a HB from 11, and 11 accepts a HB from 32.
